    "Hi , first not very sure that the issues section is the best place for this so I apologise before hand. Theres not much of a forum community online for JAX (no mailing list ?) yet, and this can almost be seen as a feature request :\n",

    "\n",
    "I spent some time reading the documentation and thinking about the problem . Using 'grad' and 'vmap' does not seem feasible since by definition this function requires an input of size $n$ and produces an output of the same size, theres no way of making it a scalar nicely, you would have to create n functions whic each return a index $i$ of $f$, which is quite tedious.\n",
